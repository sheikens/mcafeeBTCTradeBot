Hello,

Welcome to my project, feel free to send me an email at nateKM1@protonmail.com.

Support for more exchanges coming soon!

Feel free to send me a Bitcoin Cash donation here (1NLkGPnNbT9iCJ35U9UfsURANtYgNREVtq)
or email me if you want to send me something else and I will respond with an address.

I am looking for Binance api keys + Bittrex api keys, (they need to have $10 of btc on it for testing purposes since I cant register. I can offer bot #2 for free in exchange for it

Bot #1 w/ Image Detection:
  - Has the ability to pull the text from an image and will buy based off the text inside the image
  - Support for Binance + Bittrex will be added once I get the API keys
  - Already has poloniex support
  - Includes bot #2
  - Send me an email for the cost.

Bot #2
  - Supports poloniex
  - Will support Binance + Bittrex once I get API keys (see line 10 in readme).
  - Waits for user input and sends a buy request once you type in altcoin. 
  - Example: 'Image says SHIT (shitcoin x), so you type in SHIT and it will purchase specified amounts of SHIT on the exchanges you have set up.
  - Sends faster than you would if you saw image and had to open up exchange, find pairs, and manually send buy order
  - $40 donation to a 501c3 nonprofit of my choice.

How to use:

  This monitors a users twitter stream (instant) and acts on every
  tweet that It sees. It is currently pointed at the correct one.

 How to Set Up:

    1. You must get your twitter API consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, and access_token_secret and enter them on lines 14 to 18. This allows you to connect to a users twitter stream.

  ```javascript
    const T = new Twit({
    consumer_key: '',
    consumer_secret: '',
    access_token: '',
    access_token_secret: ''
   });
  ```


  2. You must give this program your Poloniex API_Key, and Secret that goes along with it (on lines 5, 6)

  ```javascript
  const API_KEY = '';
  const SECRET = '';
  ```

  3. You must choose if you want to use safecheck or not (default is true). Safecheck makes sure that the given tweet has the string coin of the day inside of it and wont buy any match without it. With safeCheck as false it will purchase any coin it sees in the tweet stream.

  4. Setting up Poloniex Class

```javascript
  const polo = new Poloniex(API_KEY, SECRET, buyAmount, markup, resell, sellMarkup);
  /*
  // const polo = new Poloniex(API_KEY, SECRET, buyAmount (default set), markup (default set as 0));
  API_KEY = the api key you recieve from the exchange poloniex; set on line 5
  SECRET = the secret you recieve from the exchange poloniex;   set on line 6
  buyAmount = the amount of BTC you want to spend on the coin that was just tweeted about (min 0.000001); set on line 12
  markup = incase another bot gets a request in faster and clears the book, this lets you send a buy with a markup.      Recomended @ should be .01 - .05; set on line 13
  Resell = if you want to resell the shitcoin instantly, is boolean (true or false) set on line 14
  sellMarkup = the markup you want to resell said shitcoin..example 1.15 will resell at purchased price + 15% set on line 15
*/
```

 To Run, make sure to have node.js + npm installed https://nodejs.org/en/
  The first command changes your current directory
  The second command installs dependencies
  The third command starts the program

```bash
   1. cd /*directory*/
   2. npm install
   3. node index.js
```
